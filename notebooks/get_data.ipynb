Higher P/E ratios suggest a company's future earnings are expected to grow and may appear overvalued compared with companies with lower P/Es. That said, a high or low P/E doesn't necessarily indicate a good or bad investment; it offers a snapshot that begs additional inquiry. Given the uncertainty of future cash flows, it can be helpful for investors to rely on historical P/Es and use a mix of other ratios to evaluate and pick stocks."

It's a useful ratio to determine whether a company has earnings, cash flow or even positive book value since sales is always a positive number. A lower ratio suggests you've found a bargain, or a value stock. Industry consensus says lower P/S stocks have better value because investors are paying less for every dollar of a company's revenues. P/S ratio values can vary across sectors, so to best assess a company's P/S, compare it with industry peers."

To determine price-free cash flow, divide the company's share price by the operating free cash flow per share. The ratio measures how much cash a company earns for each share of stock. Investors want to search for companies with growing free cash flow that are selling at a bargain. Parker favors this ratio since free cash flow is harder to manipulate than earnings.
